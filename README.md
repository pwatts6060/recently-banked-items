# Recently Banked Items
A Runelite plugin that keeps track of items you have recently withdrawn/deposited so you can quickly grab items you recently used.

Toggle the Recent View with Ctrl-R or right click the Bank Settings Menu.

Toggle locking the current items in the Recent view with Ctrl-L. Tracking of recent items still takes place but the Recent View doesn't update until unlocked.
